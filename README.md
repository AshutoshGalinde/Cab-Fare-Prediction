# Cab-Fare-Prediction
Machine Learning Project  
Tools Used: 
 Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.  NumPy: Employed for numerical computations.  Scikit-learn: Applied for implementing machine learning algorithms.  Matplotlib: Used for data visualization.  Seaborn: Engaged for statistical data visualization. 

Working Procedure:
Data Loading and Cleaning:  Necessary libraries such as Pandas and NumPy were imported.  The dataset was loaded using pandas.read_csv().  Initial data exploration was conducted to understand the structure and content of the
dataset.  Data cleaning involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting
columns appropriately. Feature Engineering:  New features were created from the existing data to enhance model performance.  Categorical variables were converted into numerical formats using one-hot encoding
and similar techniques.  Numerical features were scaled to standardize the data. Data Splitting:  The dataset was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from Scikit￾learn.  Care was taken to maintain the distribution of the target variable across the splits. Model Training:  Linear Regression was implemented using Scikit-learn.  The model was trained on the training dataset.  Predictions were made for both the training and testing datasets. Model Evaluation:  Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE).
 RMSE values for training and testing datasets were compared to check for overfitting
or underfitting.  The model’s performance was visualized using plots.

Learning Outcomes: 
The project enhanced data manipulation skills through extensive use of Pandas for cleaning
and preprocessing data. It provided valuable insights into feature engineering, demonstrating the impact of creating and transforming features on model performance. The
step-by-step implementation of Linear Regression using Scikit-learn reinforced the
understanding of machine learning workflows. Evaluation techniques using metrics like
RMSE and visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn offered a comprehensive
approach to assessing and interpreting model performance. Overall, the project solidified
various aspects of data science, from preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.
